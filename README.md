## 1. Introduction
Dev Sandbox is an Ayoba MicroApp that helps micro-app developers test their applications in 
the Ayoba environment without having their application publicly hosted. 
They can also test the changes they make in real time. 
Dev Sandbox enables developers to open their locally served applications in the Ayoba (PRE) android app.

## 2. Getting Started

### Prerequisites
An Android device or emulator with Ayoba (PRE) apk installed
The application to be tested must be served locally from a computer
Ensure that the computer and Android device/emulator you are using are connected to the same local network.

## 3. Usage

Follow these steps to use Dev Sandbox to test your application in the Ayoba environment:
1. Open Ayoba (PRE) on the android device and open the Dev Sandbox MicroApp
2. Type the address of your locally served application into the textbox, using your computer's IP address as the hostname. For example: `http://your-computer-ip-address:port`
3. Click the "Go" button to launch your application in the Ayoba Environment.
4. You can now test your applications functionality in the Ayoba environment.
